// is in the guild where the message was sent, although we don't need to worry
// about that). Until then, we can safely cast as `Message` when using the
// `fetchReply` option. Note that the `Message` constructor has been private
// since v13.2.0 (discordjs/discord.js#6732), so the Reflect.construct hack is
